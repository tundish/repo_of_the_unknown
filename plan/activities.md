Collecting sounds
-----------------

In order to collect sounds, at a minimum there must be access to the following items:
+ A recording Instrument.
+ A striking Instrument.
+ A resonating Instrument.

Once these conditions are met, perform `sampling` by activating the recorder.

Strike the resonator to trigger `recording` of the sound.
Activate the recorder to perform `playback` of the sound.

Principal Actor
    The Player Character.

Secondary Actors
    An NPC may comment on the playback of the sample.

Elaborations

    + The striking Instrument may be a hand or a foot.
    + Placing the recorder inside the resonator adds _reverb_ to the sample.
