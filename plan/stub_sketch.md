Sketch of a reluctant assistant
===============================


Ray
---

Assaulting is hard work. Being left handed didn't help.
They only make right-handed hand genades.

He reaches toward the mirror and flips it back.
His shirt-sleeve rides up and for a moment there is a glimpse
of a tattoo. The handle of an upturned dagger.
Old and overgrown, like the moss on an oak tree.

Q: Got any tattoos?
A: I can't afford tattoos.

Everyone used to call me Ray at school. When the teacher did
the register, he'd say, "Thackaray?" And the other kids would take it
in turns to say, "ray", "ray". Like an echo.

Travelling is like watching television. It goes on for fifteen minutes.
Then there is something you have to read. And it goes round and round like that.

I am leaving last night and this morning behind. I just hope something
happens before I have to go back there to this evening and tomorrow.

I'm working for this guy Ray for a day. We're going to pick up
some stuff and drive it back.

I don't mind carrying big things. I can lift heavy stuff.
I don't like tangly stuff. Like if there's bendy metal or cables and that.
That sort of stuff really annoys me. Or if it's wet.

Sometines you pick up like a box and a load of water runs out.

I haven't got my phone so they'll have to give me cash.

How much are they going to pay me? Ten pound an hour, it should be, and
I was outside waiting at quarter to six.

Where are we picking the stuff up? Ray says,
"It's a bit more complicated than that."
"I don't know where it is yet".

"You can drive, can't you?"
"Yeah, I don't mind driving", I say.

We'd get there faster for sure. I'd put my foot down. This van goes faster than seventy.

"Not now", he says. "We're going to be recovering a vehicle. It might mean you staying with the van while I bring it
back."

"Can I drive back?", I say. He looks at me. The guy doesn't like me, does he.
"I don't know yet", he says. "We'll see."

They've got a Whitchurch. My uncle lives in Whitchurch. Not this Whitchurch, another Whitchurch.

I forget to pay attention. I don't know where we are now. Some Welsh names.

"Are we going to Wales?"
"Not if I can help it. Right, I'm going to drop you off soon. I don't have a s[are phone so I'll give you this
number and maybe you can ring me from the garage. The shop[ or the garage has a phone.

He checks his phone [description of Nokia].
"Can you get me a pen out of the glovebox?" He takes a bit of card and writes a phone number on it.

"It should be up there ahead." All I can see is like a car park alongside the road and a
sort of cabin with a sign on it.

The car park is muddy and I get my laces dirty going across to the door.

Ray goes in first, then me. I can't close the door behind me, it sticks.

Inside it was bigger than I thought. It was actually part of a house which was tucked away behind.

There was this guy cooking bacon and a few people in there eating.

So I said I'll have a can of 7Up but he didn't have any only Coke.
And it wasn't even from the fridge they were just cans from a pack on the floor.

So I said fuck it, just give me my money for this morning and I'm out of here. Ray goes, "whatever you think I owe you,
you're wrong, buddy."

So I said no, you're wrong, give me twenty quid.

So he gives me twenty quid and I ask about the buses, because there's a bus stop outside and the guy
behind the counter says you're out of luck there's no buses today, they don't come every day.

So I say how the fuck do I get out of here and he says you'll have to walk. But you can't go on the main
road because there's no pavement you have to go out the back and cross the river if you want to get to Ross.

So I did and it took me fucking ages to get there and all day to get back home.
And I got mud all up my legs, and I had to put my trainers in the washing machine.
