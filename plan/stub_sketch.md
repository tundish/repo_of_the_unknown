Sketch of a reluctant assistant
===============================


Ray
---

Assaulting is hard work. Being left handed didn't help.
They only make right-handed hand genades.

He reaches toward the mirror and flips it back.
His shirt-sleeve rides up and for a moment there is a glimpse
of a tattoo. The handle of an upturned dagger.
Old and overgrown, like the moss on an oak tree.

Q: Got any tattoos?
A: I can't afford tattoos.

Everyone used to call me Ray at school. When the teacher did
the register, he'd say, "Thackaray?" And the other kids would take it
in turns to say, "ray", "ray". Like an echo.

Travelling is like watching television. It goes on for fifteen minutes.
Then there is something you have to read. And it goes round and round like that.

I am leaving last night and this morning behind. I just hope something
happens before I have to go back there to this evening and tomorrow.

I'm working for this guy Ray for a day. We're going to pick up
some stuff and drive it back.
