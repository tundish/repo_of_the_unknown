Characters
----------

It was Wednesday before I wrote any code.

There had been scant opportunity do do so, and in any case, I did not know where to start.
Instead, over the first few days there started to form in my mind's eye a flicker of an opening
sequence. Silent, like the start of a road movie. The darkened profile of a passenger from the
inside of a speeding vehicle.

A new possibility for the word *repo*. Two characters in a van on the way to a job. I began to imagine
some dialogue. Which is the player; the driver or mate?

Example 12 is about styles and procedural dialogue.
There's a slight possibility of including images, but not a priority right now.
