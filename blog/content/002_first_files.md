Too early to know how to structure scene files, so start with Dialogue in Python modules.
Starting point: Balladeer example 12.

Example 12 is about styles and procedural dialogue.

* Check PyPI for package name availability.
* Use hatchling  https://pypi.org/project/hatchling/ as build backend.
* [Conversation Trees](https://balladeer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/conversation.html)
* Walk the dog.
