summary: In which we get ourselves into a Jam.

An opportunity arises
---------------------

It's the end of October. I've been fixing a couple of bugs in [Balladeer](https://tundish.github.io/balladeer).
I'm happy with it. The code feels pretty solid now.

Maybe it could use just one more teaching example though. No ideas yet however.

In any case, it's going to be a big weekend.
New Zealand are playing South Africa in the final of the Rugby World Cup.
Probably not the right time to begin a new writing project. Too many distractions right now.

For some reason I visit Itch.io, the game hosting portal. And guess what? Today is the start of the
[eighth Python Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/python-game-jam-8). An invitation to spend the next ten days in a race
to build a game and submit it for judgement by strangers.

So I sign up.

Set up to fail
--------------

I'm not stupid. I know this is a tall order. The competition is ten days long but I calculate I'll be lucky
if I can average 2 hours a day amidst the other demands on my time. It's unlikely I'll be able to make anything
very compelling. But it might provide another example demo for Balladeer.

The competition theme is announced. It's *The Unknown*.

So I log in to Github, and I create a new public repository. I call it *Repo Of The Unknown*.

That will have to be all for now. The Rugby is on.
