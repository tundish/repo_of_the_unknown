summary: In which we get ourselves into a Jam.

An opportunity arises
=====================

It's the end of October. I've been fixing a couple of bugs in [Balladeer](https://tundish.github.io/balladeer).
I'm happy with it. The code feels pretty solid now.

Maybe it's time to build another project as a teaching example. No ideas yet though.

In any case, it's going to be a big weekend. England are playing South Africa in the semi-final of the Rugby World Cup.


[Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/python-game-jam-8)

Theme: The Unknown.

Some ideas (see below)

Watching the Rugby was the right thing to do.

Planning the next 10 days XXxxxxxXX

Priority is CSS layout while I have access to a large screen.

Ideas
-----

We begin in the cab of a van. Player is young. just starting to help in a company of repo men.
No phone coverage.

Story will be mostly on rails, with some parse exploration.

Missions/Tasks nee questions/answers ans Ask/Say syntax.

Populate list data for input text.

500 cues of SpeechMark?

Too early to know how to structure scene files, so start with Dialogue in Python modules.
Starting point: Balladeer example 12.
