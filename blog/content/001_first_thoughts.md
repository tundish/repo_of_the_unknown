summary: In which we get ourselves into a Jam.

An opportunity arises
---------------------

It's the end of October. I've been fixing a couple of bugs in [Balladeer](https://tundish.github.io/balladeer).
I'm happy with it. The code feels pretty solid now.

Maybe it could use just one more teaching example though. No ideas yet however.

In any case, it's going to be a big weekend. England are playing South Africa in the semi-final of the Rugby World Cup.
Probably not the right time to begin a new writing project. Too many distractions right now.

For some reason I visit Itch.io, the game hosting portal. And guess what? Today is the start of the
[eighth Python Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/python-game-jam-8). An invitation to spend the next ten days in a race
to build a game and submit it for judgement by strangers.

So I sign up.

Don't panic

Theme: The Unknown.

Some ideas (see below)

Watching the Rugby was the right thing to do.

Planning the next 10 days XXxxxxxXX

Priority is CSS layout while I have access to a large screen.

Ideas
-----

We begin in the cab of a van. Player is young. just starting to help in a company of repo men.
No phone coverage.

Story will be mostly on rails, with some parse exploration.

Missions/Tasks nee questions/answers ans Ask/Say syntax.

Populate list data for input text.

500 cues of SpeechMark?

Too early to know how to structure scene files, so start with Dialogue in Python modules.
Starting point: Balladeer example 12.
