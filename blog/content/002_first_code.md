summary: Some initial thoughts on the first full day of the Jam

Ideas
-----

We begin in the cab of a van. Player is young. just starting to help in a company of repo men.
No phone coverage.

Story will be mostly on rails, with some parse exploration.

Missions/Tasks nee questions/answers ans Ask/Say syntax.

Populate list data for input text.

500 cues of SpeechMark?

Too early to know how to structure scene files, so start with Dialogue in Python modules.
Starting point: Balladeer example 12.

Copy an Example
---------------

Example 12 is about styles and procedural dialogue.
There's a slight possibility of including images, but not a priority right now.
